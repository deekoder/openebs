#Introduction to OpenEBS

OpenEBS is a storage platform, written in GoLang, to deliver persistent block storage for container eco system. The storage itself is containerized through a storage POD concept called VSM or "Virtual Storage Machine". VSMs are scheduled and managed using an orchestrator engine called "Maya". VSMs are fully isolated user space storage engines that present the block storage at the front end through iSCSI, NBD or TCMU protocol and consume raw storage from a local OpenEBS host or remote storage.  

#Components of OpenEBS platform
OpenEBS platform contains three major components
 * Storage PODs or VSMs
 * An orchestration engine or VSM Scheduler called Maya
 * The OpenEBS hosts that provide the data store from either local disks or remote disks

Maya is the orchestration engine that schedules the VSMs among OpenEBS hosts as needed. Maya driver (Docker Volume Driver for Maya) plays an important role in achieving the smooth flow of provisioning of VSMs and attaining the application consistent snapshots. The data is kept in more than one copy among the OpenEBS hosts through a backend network replication, thus achieving the necessary redundancy. VSMs expose the iSCSI interface currently. 

The backend data store for Jiva containers come either through locally managed disks or through remotely managed network disks. The intelligent caching along with the lazy read indexing capability makes it possible to treat remote S3 storage also as the backing data store (Refer to the Roadmap: TBD)

#Built with the best tools 
OpenEBS uses the best available infrastructure libraries underneath. Jiva (means "life" in Sanskrit) is the core software that runs inside the storage container. The core functionalities of Jiva include 
* Block storage protocol (iSCSI/TCMU/NBD)
* Replication
* Snapshotting
* Caching to NVMe
* Encryption 
* Backup/Restore
* QoS 
Jiva inherits majority of its capabilities from Rancher Longhorn (https://github.com/rancher/longhorn). QoS, Caching, Backup/Restore capabilities are being added to Jiva.

#Programmable storage
Maya is designed to have developer friendly interfaces to configure, deploy and manage the storage platform. Maya provides the configuration through YAML files and automation is made possible through ansible and/or terraform

#Jiva overview

OpenEBS is delivered through container architecture called VSM (Virtual Storage Machine), to provide storage. A VSM can be considered as Storage Pod,a set of containers - a frontend-container and one or more backend-containers. 

![OpenEBS Storage Pod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/master/docs/images/OpenEBSVSMTechnicalOverview.png)

The frontend container takes care of providing access to the block storage, example iscsi, and handles the data input/output operations and data management functions like - snapshots, replication, caching, metering etc., 

The backend container(s) are configured with a persistent backend storage using local disks or remote disks. The controller will replicate the data inot the storage-containers and the storage containers also participate in building new backends for a VSM, restoring the data from snapshots, transferring snapshots to clouds, etc., Storage-containers can be added/removed dynamically to an VSM. 

The VSM/Storage Pod - containers provisioning, scheduling and monitoring is taken care by OpenEBS Maya Master (omm), the storage orchestration layer. The VSM storage-containers will be running on the OpenEBS Storage Hosts (osh), which typically would either have hard disks/SSDs or mounted file/block/s3 storage.

The frontend and backend containers are launched using the [jiva image](https://hub.docker.com/r/openebs/jiva/).
